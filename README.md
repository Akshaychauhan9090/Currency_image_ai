🌐 Universal Currency Recognition AI with Webcam & Real-Time Conversion
This project uses AI, Computer Vision, and live exchange rates to recognize currency notes from multiple countries using a webcam. It predicts the currency name, country, and denomination, and converts it to any other currency (e.g., INR, USD, EUR, etc.) in real-time.

🚀 Built with the vision to be used with real-world robots in banks, kiosks, or travel counters for physical note handling and global transactions.
